# JavaScript_Countdown_Project
A simple countdown timer that displays the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds until a certain event.
The countdown timer is made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design is simple and minimal, with the countdown timers displayed in a grid layout.
# How to Use?
To use this project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The countdown timer will automatically start counting down from the specified time.
